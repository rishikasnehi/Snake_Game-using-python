# Snake Game using Python

Welcome to the Snake Game project! This is a classic implementation of the Snake game using Python. The project features a playable GUI version of the Snake game and is a great starting point for beginners looking to learn Python, game development concepts, or even enhance the game with new features.

## Features

- **Classic Snake Gameplay:** Control a snake to eat food, growing longer with each bite.
- **Score Tracking:** Keep track of your score as your snake grows.
- **Game Over Detection:** The game ends when the snake hits itself or the wall.
- **Graphical User Interface:** Built using Python's popular graphics libraries.
- **Easy to Customize:** Ideal for experimentation with game rules, graphics, and mechanics.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) library (if used)
  - Install via pip:  
    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rishikasnehi/Snake_Game-using-python.git
    cd Snake_Game-using-python
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**  
   If the game uses Pygame or other libraries, install them:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
   Or, install Pygame directly:
    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```

3. **Run the game**
    ```bash
    python snake_game.py
    ```
    *(Make sure to use the correct file name if it's different in the repo.)*

## Gameplay Instructions

- Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction.
- Eat the food to increase the snake's length and score.
- Avoid colliding with the snake's own body and the boundaries.



## Customizing

You can modify the game by:
- Changing the speed or grid size.
- Adding obstacles or power-ups.
- Enhancing UI and sound effects.
